Just A Concept (http://www.justaconcept.org/) interactive story project

May run slow on older phones, but that does not prevent gameplay (only the animations are slower).
An open-source hactivist idea for an interactive story. Just A Concept is about trying new things - this time to bring an interactive narration and to hope that some people will actually start to take more interest (your media will cover only what they expect you to be interested in and crime against humanity usually do not happen in front of a camera).
All of media used are supposedly public domain or creative commons licensed, but given the hactivist nature of the game, the material will be removed, if asked by author.
